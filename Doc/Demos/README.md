# Demos

These are a few demonstrations of the PmodADC and PmodDAC.

For each song, I provided the original (mono) wav file, the song played by
my phone and recorded on the PmodADC, and the song played throught the 
PmodDAC and recorded with a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 Interface.

All music by Kevin MacLeod, see Music Attribution below.

[PmodDAC Demos will follow in a few days]
